# char_dev_driver
Linux character device drvier for a number (2) of sensors temperature, luminosity and battery voltage, wirelessly connected to a base station to which they sent data. Base station connected to pc via usb. Important note: only the upper level of the driver will be uploaded which implements system calls OPEN, RELEASE, READ. That's the functions we implemented and do not suffice for a working driver, as more low-level (and not only) functions are needed.
